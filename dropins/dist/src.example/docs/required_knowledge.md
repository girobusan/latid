title: Required knowledge

The idea behind Laitid is to create static site developer
tool, oriented to general public, and to minimize required
skill level for content editor/developer.


To edit content of Latid site
-------------------

One, who wants to edit content, needs to know:

1. How to install node.js (you'll need only clean node install, no fancy stuff)
1. How to run commands in terminal (command line)
1. How to run command from specified directory
1. How to use Latid (this docs)

Also, there is a GUI app which removes all those requirements except the last one.

To develop themes/design 
-------------------------

For designing Latid site you'll need the skills, listed before plus

1. Webdesign basics, knowledge of html and css 
2. Knowledge of nunjucks template engine

To publish Latid site
---------------------
Depends on your hosting provider. For basic 20th-century-style setup you must
know only how to upload files to remote server. Latid sites are static,
in most cases you'll need no configuration, just somehow put
your files to their side. That's it. Also look [here](deploy.md).
