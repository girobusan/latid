title: Required knowledge
---

The idea behind Laitid is to create static site developer
tool, oriented to general public, so to minimize required
skill level for content editor/developer.

This is a list of skills, which you'll need to learn in order to use Latid. The
document lists only skills, required for maintaining site
content. You need separate set of skills in order to
publish your content.

To run a Latid site
-------------------

One, who wants to edit content, needs to know:

1. How to install node.js (you'll need only clean node install, no fancy stuff)
1. How to run commands in terminal (command line)
1. How to run command from specified directory
1. How to use Latid (this docs)

Also, there is  a GUI app on it's way,
which removes these requirements (except last one).

To develop themes/design 
-------------------------

For designing Latid site you'll need the skills, listed before plus
basic web design skills,
and knowledge of the Nunjucks template engine.
