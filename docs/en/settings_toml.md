title: Settings file
---

Earlier versions of Latid used JSON formatted config. Now we're using TOML 
because:

- It is much simpler to write and maintain.
- It's possible to use comments.

If you have old config in JSON and don't want to change it's format immediately,
you may keep it â€” it's still used as fallback (but consider updating). But please, do not have both
`settings.toml` and `settings.json` in same `_config` directory. It will lead to
unpredictable malfunctions.

This is a commented Latid config file (`_config/settings.toml`).
