title: Java Script workaround 
---

If your site has scripts, which are launched on DOMContentLoaded or something like this, they might not launch in GUI mode. 

The problem arises because pages in GUI are not loaded as usual, but redrawn using scripts. So, there is no "loaded" events. Possible workaround may look like this:

    function myStuff(){
        //here all your the code go
    }

    //add this as regular event listener

    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded" , myStuff);

    //this one for GUI

    if(document.readyState === 'complete'){
        myStuff();
    }
