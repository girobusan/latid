title: JSON source files
---
JSON format is specific for Latid. It has the following advantages:

- *Flexible.* Block editor allows richer customization of article parts, with Latid you can even build your own templates for different blocks
- Semantic. Easily parsed or generated by custom software, you can, for example, build an app from your site sources, or add some other production routines.

When you choose to create file from GUI, JSON is a default choice.
