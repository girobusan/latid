Design decisions behind Latid is driven not only by technical and
aesthetic considerations, but also by some kind of ideology.

Guerrilla web
------------

Latid is built for use under pressure. Unfortunately, we live
in the world, where freedom of speech is oppressed on regular basis. Web sites are blocked,
either by state authorities or by other parties, web creators prosecuted or _canceled_. So, what 
do you, as guerrilla web author, need from your site generator?

### Hide and deny

Your site with everything needed for its operation kept in one directory.
It's easy to hide it somewhere and than deny the very fact of its existence.
There are no specific libraries or external modules to keep, the node.js
is legal and its presence may be easily justified.


### Easy move your authoring work to other computer

You may need to change your working computer at any time. With Latid you only need to install 
node.js to start working. 

### Change hosting provider easily

That's where the relative linking comes in handy. You may put your site to dedicated domain, than
move it to other, and other day -- to some subdirectory at your comrade server, and it will work.

### Use other communication channels

Relative linking makes transition to Dark web
pretty easy. You can even pack your site to zip archive and send it by email.

### For all your illegal goals

You, as a guerrilla web creator,  may want to make 
a blog on some forbidden subject, or documents collection,
or landing page for your recruiting event. Or you would like to have blog and documentation 
combined. Or... I do not know, and do not want to know. That's why there is absolutely no
implications on your site structure in Latid.

And if you plan to change structure in future -- use "plus links" in all your documents, and they
will stay intact even if target document will be moved.


Separated user experiences
--------------------------

There are three user experiences involved in web site creation:

- Web design
- Environment setup
- Content creation
